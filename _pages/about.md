Hi, my name is Vishaal Agartha. 
===============================

Welcome to my corner of the Internet.
===============================

I'm a 22 year old computer scientist who recently graduated from UCLA. I'm currently working as a Frontend and Data Visualization Engineer at [Trifecta Inc](www.trifecta.com). I recently applied for a Master's program and aspire to become a data scientist and machine learning engineer. My other passions include rockclimbing and NBA basketball analytics. 

On the rockclimbing spectrum, I'm primarily a boulderer. Bouldering consists of short 'problems' compared to sport climbing or even big wall climbing. Routes are typically 20-30 ft off the ground and require anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute of intense movement.

Although I enjoy data visualization and front end engineering, my ultimate career goal is NBA sports analytics. Hence, I spend a lot of my free time trying to find interesting patterns and insights into the wild, dynamic sport of basketball. My dream job is to work in the cross-section of computer science and sports. I believe the NBA is undergoing a technological revolution and teams can gain an edge by analyzing large amounts of data via artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.
