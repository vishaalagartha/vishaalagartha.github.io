Hi, my name is Vishaal Agartha. 
===============================

Welcome to my corner of the Internet.
===============================

I'm a 26 year old software engineer who recently completed his Master's in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to beginning my masters, I spent 2 years working as a software engineer specializing in front-end development at Wells Fargo Inc. after graduating from UCLA with a B.S. in Computer Science. My other passions include rockclimbing and sports analytics. 

On the rockclimbing spectrum, I'm primarily a boulderer. Bouldering consists of short 'problems' compared to sport climbing or even big wall climbing. Routes are typically 20-30 ft off the ground and require anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute of intense movement.

I am also extremely passionate about career goal is NBA sports analytics. Hence, I spend a lot of my free time trying to find interesting patterns and insights into the wild, dynamic sport of basketball. I enjoy to work in the cross-section of computer science and sports. I believe the NBA is undergoing a technological revolution and teams can gain an edge by analyzing large amounts of data via artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.
