About Me
========
I'm a 22 year old recent graduate from UCLA's Computer Science program. Currently, I work as a frontend and data visualization engineer for [Trifecta Inc.](https://www.trifectachain.com). I recently submitted my Master's applications for computer science and hope to specialize in data science. My other passions include basketball and rockclimbing. 

The goal of this blog is provide a platform for me to describe my experiences, thoughts, and current projects. In other words, I consider this to be a simple location for my brain dump.

If you're interested in my credentials or an overall summary of me, please refer to my [Resume](https://vishaalagartha.github.io/resume).

If you're a software engineer interested in my projects, refer to my [Projects](https://vishaalagartha.github.io/projects).

If you're a rockclimber, you may be interested in my [Rockclimbing](https://vishaalagartha.github.io/rockclimbing) page.

Finally, if you're looking for my brain dump and notes, check out my [Notes](https://vishaalagartha.github.io/notes) page.
