### [2024-01-17: Threadalytics - A Real Time NBA Sentiment Analysis Platform](/projects/2024/01/17/threadalytics)

Watching NBA games goes hand-in-hand with chatting and posting on social media sites like Twitter on Reddit.

This project aims to capture Reddit sentiment of NBA players, teams, and coaches during NBA games.

### [2022-01-18: Predicting NBA Games using Recurrent Neural Networks](/projects/2023/01/18/nba-game-prediction)

The goal of this project was to create a Recurrent Neural Network to predict NBA game results.

I'm happy to say that my model achieve ~78% accuracy on both training and validation datasets, which performs equivalent to most high level models (such as 538's RAPTOR, ELO, etc).

### [2020-03-23: Simulating NBA Player Interviews using GPT-2](/projects/2020/03/23/gpt2)

I've been trying to create better language models than the standard technique of text generation using Recurrent Neural Networks.

I realized that this is simply impossible with the given resources and amount of data I have, so I opted to use [Open AI's GPT-2 model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), a more complex version of the standard model I created [here](https://vishaalagartha.github.io/notes/2020/03/12/subreddit-simulator). The results were quite satisfying and interesting.

### [2020-02-25: Analyzing Playoff vs. Regaular Season Play Types](/projects/2020/02/25/playtype)

Analysts and old timers say that the *game slows down* in the playoffs. They argue that certain offenses won't work in the playoffs.

This post investigates this theory using Synergy Play Type data from 2015 onward.

### [2020-02-24: threadalytics](/projects/2020/02/24/threadalytics)

I love [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) and NBA subreddits in general. The goal of this project was to analyze Game Threads and provide sentiment analysis on individual Game Threads.

Note that I will not be posting explanations for this post as I want to keep this project under wraps.

### [2020-01-29: Analyzing Voter Fatigue in NBA Individual Awards](/projects/2020/01/29/voter-fatigue)

Halfway through the season, we start analyzing individual award candidates. 
In 2020, we have 2 candidates for MVP and DPOY in Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert who look more and more likely to repeat. Yet, detractors say that voters will tend away from these candidates due to **voter fatigue**. What is voter fatigue and how does much does it affect the individual awards? 
The goal of this project is to analyze the voter fatigue phenomenon.

### [2020-01-22: Predicting the Coach of the Year](/projects/2020/01/22/coy-predictor)

Machine Learning models have been used to predict everything in basketball from
the All Star Starters to James Harden's next play. One model that has never been
made is a successful Coach of the Year Predictor. The goal of this project is to
create such a model.

### [2020-01-15: The Basketball Reference Scraper](/projects/2020/01/15/bbref-scraper)

Basketball Reference is a great resource to aggregate statistics on NBA teams, seasons, players, and games. This package provides methods to acquire data for all these categories in pre-parsed and simplified formats in Python.

This post provides a description of the step-by-step process to build a complete static or dynamic web scraper and how I did it with Basketball Reference.

### [2019-11-23: `d3-plot3d`](/projects/2019/11/23/d3-plot3d)

d3-plot3d is a D3 plugin that allows users to plot 3D data, lines, polygons, curves, and surfaces

### [2019-11-10: Visualizing NBA Team Standings Change](/projects/2019/11/10/standing-change)

A cool visualization using d3 of NBA team standings changes over the past few decades.

### [2019-11-05: Plotting the NBA Efficiency Landscape](/projects/2019/11/05/plotting-efficiency-landscape)

How can we visualize the NBA Efficiency Landscape? How do teams compare according Net Rating, Offensive Rating, and Defensive Rating? Let's use Bokeh, a fancy Python plotting library to explore.

### [2019-10-14: Unicorn Hunting in the NBA](/projects/2019/10/14/unicorn-hunting)

The Ringer has released it's list of [Unicorns](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/10/8/20899215/unicorn-rankings-2019-20) in the NBA. Is this a reasonable list objectively?

In this post, I explore what it means to be a *unicorn* in the NBA and compute my own unicorns to compare them against The Ringer's.

### [2019-10-02: Moving the Three Point Line](/projects/2019/10/02/moving-three-line)

With all this talk of moving the three point line backward due to the modern three point revolution, I decided to explore how the top 3-pt shooters would be affected.

### [2019-09-01: Understanding Marginal Contributions of NBA players using Shapley Values](/projects/2019/09/01/nba-shapley)

With all these advanced stats, we still don't know how to quantify NBA players in a group setting. How much does player X contribute to the team? How much does player Y contribute to the starting 5? This project aims to answer these types of questions using Game Theory.

### [2019-07-03: Grouping Game of Thrones Characters using TF-IDF](/projects/2019/07/03/got-clustering)

As the show comes to an end, let's do some some NLP to group Game of Thrones characters using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency

### [2019-06-24: Clustering NBA Teams using K-Means](/projects/2019/06/24/nba-teams-clustering)

NBA teams are often grouped by era like the 'early 80's' or 'the modern pace and space'. Can we create such abstractions around teams? This post investigates the theory.

### [2019-05-13: Understanding Player Activity using NBA Game Logs](/projects/2019/05/13/player-activity)

People often criticize Andrew Wiggins or Devin Booker as players who *disappear* during stretches of the game.

How can we understand how *active* a player is? This post scrapes and visualizes player occurrences in NBA game logs to see how active players are.

### [2019-02-05: Exploring Market Inefficiencies: Perimeter Defense](/projects/2019/02/05/market-inefficiencies)

Let's test the theory of Perimeter Defense as a market inefficiency in NBA sports gambling.
