Recently, on the Hoop Collective Podcast, Kirk Goldsberry discussed the G-League's experiment with the single free throw. Currently, the G-League only shoots 1 free throw valued at 2 points or 3 points if behind the 3-point line.

Naturally, this would shorten the game by approximately 6-8 minutes they said and increase the value of the free throw. An additional twist is looking at 1st free throw vs. 2nd free throw percentages to see how certain players shoot worse on their 1st (due to fatigue, practice, etc).

I investigated the drop off between 2nd and 1st free throw % for top free throw shooters. All data was acquired by scraping game logs from the 2018-19 season and the current season in progress. I also set a threshold of at least 300 free throws to filter out anomalies:

Here are the charts. I hope you enjoy them!
