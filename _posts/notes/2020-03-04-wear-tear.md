TLDR; Plots: [MPG](https://i.imgur.com/0nI6WWv.png), [Distance Logged](https://i.imgur.com/cqHmJHF.png), [Speed](https://i.imgur.com/1wdousu.png)

In the recent [Lowe Post](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive/_/id/10528553) podcast with Kevin Arnovitz, Zach Lowe asks whether the Bucks should go for 70 wins.
He goes on to say that, of course they should since the MPG of their starters is not too high.

Later on in the podcast, he questions the Bucks' methodology of playing Giannis limited minutes and asks whether it is viable in the playoffs. He dismisses this, arguing that he "plays so hard" when he's out there.

Thus, I decided to look at the greatest regular season teams and their MPG, Distance logged per game, and Average Speed per game.

Obviously, these are not perfect metrics of activity, but I thought they may show some insight.

## MPG

MPG data was aggregated for the 2019-20 Bucks, the 2015-16 Warriors, and the 1995-96 Bulls (all teams with 70+ wins).

![Here is the plot](https://i.imgur.com/0nI6WWv.png)

Takeaways:
* MPG has (obviously) decreased over time
* MPG has become more evently distributed over time (e.g. Pippen and Jordan played *a lot* more than the rest)
* I feel like there is an exaggeration of how **hard** the Bulls played. It seems like Jordan didn't average too many more minutes than Green during the Warrior's season
* Yes, the Bucks have a very even and lowly distributed MPG - not just for Giannis! 

## Average Distance (mi)

Second Spectrum data was introduced in the 2013-14 season, hence distance data was not available for the Bulls.

Takeaways:
* Curry and Thompson logged **so much more** than everyone else. One would expect all guards to have similar statistics, except Bledsoe and Matthews don't! I think this has to do with the Warriors guard-focused, 'free' style of play?
* Giannis doesn't really haul ass like Lowe was arguing. I know distance may not be the best metric, but it counts for something right?

## Average Speed (mph)

Second Spectrum data was introduced in the 2013-14 season, hence speed data was not available for the Bulls.

Takeaways:
* Wow! Harrison Barnes does not get the credit he deserves haha
* Overall speed seems relatively the same
* Once again - Giannis does not outpace players by too much

## Overall
I think the whole wear and tear argument has been overstated **on both sides**. I don't think Jordan's Bulls played too hard and the current Bucks aren't resting too much. An opportunity to go for 70 wins trumps all, in my opinion, and the Bucks should gun for it.

Additionally, I think there is a myth on how hard Giannis plays when he is on the court. It seems he logs the same distance/speed as his peers and predecessors.
