Inspired by [Bill Simmons' recent podcast](https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2019/5/6/18531003/nba-overreactions-jokic-love-currys-struggles-in-search-of-ben-simmons-and-throne-game-joe-house) where he asks for a stat to record the number of game where a team has been down by a large amount, I created this plot. 
The blue dots indicate the number of games that each team has been down by 5, the orange dots indicate the number of games that each team has been down by 10, etc. Enjoy!

This is in the programming section because this was my first experience using matplotlib and seaborn sns library to plot data.
Here is the plot:

Some notes:

* RIP the Suns and Cavaliers
* Interestingly, most teams have a similar number of large deficits. Bill was saying how the Celtics have been down by 15 so many times this year, but they appear to be in the middle of the pack. Of course, they can't compare to the top tier teams like the Bucks, Warriors, or Raptors.
