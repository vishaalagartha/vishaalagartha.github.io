After listening to the recent [Bill Simmons Podcast](https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2019/8/14/20805930/team-usas-breakout-stars-a-hilarious-clips-lakers-feud-and-lebron-2020-predictions-brian-windhorst), I was interested in whether it was valuable or not for players to spend summers with Team USA. He mentioned Derrick Rose and KD's summer performances as massive stepping stones into stardom. So...

Below, I look at differences in player PER's before and after summers with Team USA. The last chart looks at the average difference in PER. 

Here's the 2002 chart:

Here's the 2006 chart:

Here's the 2010 chart:

Here's the 2014 chart:

Finally, here are the average differences in PER:

Clearly, in 2010 and 2014, average difference in PER was positive and players DID improve.

Even though the NBA has a lot changed over the past 4-8 years, it seems like younger players seem to benefit a decent amount from spending the summer with Team USA. Why don't more players want to be in that environment (I'm looking at you Devin Booker)?

Some other thoughts:
- it seems to benefit younger players and some of these guys were going to see decreases in PER most likely anyway (age, outlier years, etc)
- I would assume age is a factor. For younger guys it’s great because their bodies can handle the extra load, and it’s GREAT experience. For older players however, wear and tear is exponentially worse, and I assume it would take way more of a toll on them to not have that rest time
- Devin Booker declined months ago because he's been dinged up with nagging injuries and wants to focus on the upcoming season. Kid has to stay healthy, hard to knock him for it.

Of course, the ultimate test is to compare these results to other groups like comparing the players that participated to those who didn't. Maybe a project for another day!
