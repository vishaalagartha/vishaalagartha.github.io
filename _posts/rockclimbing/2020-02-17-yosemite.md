# 02/15/2020 - The El Cap Boulder, Sentinal Boulders, and Awhanee  

## Spock Direct (V8) at the El Cap Boulder 

In my [last post](/rockclimbing/2020/02/01/yosemite) I mentioned how I was able to send Spock Was Here (V6) and was planning on finishing up the V8 sit start. I executed the crux first move - a very whippy* movement. It was a clear sign of improvement in skill on my end that I was psyched by. The key to the movement was **both** feet on the wall, **not** locking off and launching. It reminds me a of the first move on a Kilter Board (sandbagged) V4 called Grandola - A+ problem.

## Post Send Depression (V7) at the Sentinal Boulders

Post Send Depression is a very spanny dihedral at the Sentinal Boulders. [Here's a video](http://betabase.blogspot.com/2011/11/11-7-11-post-send-depression.html?m=0), for reference.

Vikas and I tried the very first 2 moves and deemed it too spanny. I know this may sound like a lame excuse, but we literally couldn't reach the holds. Reasonable to say, I thought, and another problem to cross off the list.

## Slapshot (V8) at the Sentinal Boulders

Slapshot is the definition of a one move wonder. I pretty much flashed it into the crux move. The crux move can be done 2 ways:

* [Drop in far right off a terrible left hand crimp and a high right foot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ywTaeB-LTk)
* [Do a wild wind up move from a narrow position with the left hand, using a seam as a foot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF5OIb3tC0o)

After experimenting, we decided to execute the move the second way. I found the move within reach, but need a little more power to launch that far. There are 2 factors that limited me here
* Right hand crimp/pinch strength
* Driving off the high left foot

I think I could improve my foot tension on the seam foot (as usual). Vikas and I have opted to give this one a break as well.

## Seems So (V8) at the Sentinal Boulders 

Seems So was the problem we got closest to in Sentinal. It's kind of lowball, but we were able to execute all the moves. The two cruxes to the problem are the first move (rendering it a pseudo-crux) and a high bump off of a narrow crimp position into a pocket.

I was able to stick the first move a couple times. Clearly, it goes, but I want to improve my pinch strength. The [Wrist Wrench](https://www.armassassinstrengthshop.com/collections/featured-collection/products/axle-wrench) from Arm Assassin is my new toy that I plan on using to improve this strength. My goal is to get the beefiest forearms on the planet and this should help me accomplish that.

The second crux move was an issue of deadpoint. It felt terrible to hike up the high foot and deadpoint into a pocket. My body just wouldn't engage. My deadpointing game, as usual needs improvement.

## Pugilist (V9) at the Awhanee Boulders

This was a late night session at the Pugilist where we kind of botched the beta. We opted for [this version](https://vimeo.com/11449747) and realized that there was an [alternative beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd4GOVwP7O4) the next day. I'll talk more about this problem in the next day post.
