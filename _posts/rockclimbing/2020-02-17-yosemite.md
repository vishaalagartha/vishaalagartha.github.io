# 02/15/2020 - The El Cap Boulder, Sentinal Boulders, and Awhanee  

## Spock Direct (V8) at the El Cap Boulder 

In my [last post](/rockclimbing/2020/02/01/yosemite) I mentioned how I was able to send Spock Was Here (V6) and was planning on finishing up the V8 sit start. I executed the crux first move - a very whippy* movement. It was a clear sign of improvement in skill on my end that I was psyched by. The key to the movement was **both** feet on the wall, **not** locking off and launching. It reminds me a of the first move on a Kilter Board (sandbagged) V4 called Grandola - A+ problem.
