With all this talk about moving the 3PT line, I wanted to investigate how moving the 3PT Line would affect leading 3PT shooters using data from the 2018-19 season. I created plots to visualize the court and the change in made 3PT field goals over the season.

Just for kicks, I looked into moving the 3PT line to 19.75ft (high school), 20.75ft (WNBA), 22.15ft (FIBA/NCAA), 23.75ft (current NBA), 24ft, 25ft, 26ft, 27ft, and 28ft.

Also, note that the high school and WNBA 3PT arcs are pure arcs whereas the rest are only partial arcs and straighten out toward the corner, making the distance shorter. Hence, when acquiring data, I ensured that shots classified as "Corner 3's" were counted if they were from these shorter distances.

Here's the high school chart

Here are some general takeaways from this project:
- I love watching Brook Lopez just climb his way on up the leaderboards as the distance gets further
- Steph would still be the GOAT Shooter
- I was surprised at how little Harden improved with a shortened line... but then i realized that mid rangers are a thing but not if you're a Rocket
